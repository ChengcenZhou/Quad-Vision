# Quad-Vision
#DotStar Reflection

Chengcen Connie Zhou

At first, I want to thank Abhishek Kishore Modi and Naren Sivagnanadasan.  Quad Vision choose an really ambitious  topic this semester. We have to do both hardware and software. Modi and Naren helped us a lot.

See back to what I struggled with, gained, liked and hated, I found out I really have many things to share. Before the class I hardly have any coding experience. Since I am junior in Statistics and Economics major, the most frequent coding language I use is R. Everything is totally new to me at this point and I have to learn C++ from zero background. I gained friends, recognizing and resolving bugs and we really achieve the process of turn a concept into a product. I am so proud of Quad Vision.

I would say I make a big difference comparing to one self without DotStar experience. I found out the charming of computer science. It sounds like a group of crazy people come with some crazy ideas and they finally made it. This is super exciting experience. I get to know this course because of Tom. As he rushed to the front of CS 125 classroom, I believe everyone would think the same way as I did, how passion this guy was. After Tom’s pitch, I know this is what I want to do and it will make my college experience an extremely different. Computer science doesn’t means a any specific language to me, it’s a friend you could work with to achieve whatever idea in your mind. Also during the coding experience, I learned the problem solving skill, struggle with bugs could be my entire memory for this semester. I found a tip to debug I would love to share, everytime when you stocked with a bug. Just forget about this, try to do something fun to you. When you back to programming after a while, usually you could debug efficiently.

I edited the final video for the presentation. This makes me realize that not only have coding skills but also you have to know how to sell your products and let people want to use your products. Be familiar with iMovie editing also plays a significant role. I am so glad that I could contribute to our team with my skills. I majority worked in Control group in Quad Vision.

All the micro class DotStar holds are really nice. CAs prepared a lot before each speech. Data Structures and Dynamic Programming make the most sense to me. Micro class used the limit time to open the window for me to get be familiar with coding, especially as a non-cs major student. One future advise, I hope if I get the chance to take the course again, we could divide the course into several small sections and let us have the right to choose which topic I am interested to go to. All in all, DotStar team did a really good job. 

In the future, I will continue to look for chance like DotStar and get my team to startup with something about fashion experience. Initially, I only came with the idea. I will process this in this summer and make it come true online first. I always told by friends that I am talent at accommodation fashion design.  I want to do something relative to this and make it approachable to everybody. Like man-machine interaction experience. This idea makes me feel really excited. One day you will see my video giving a speech to sell my products, don’t be surprised.
